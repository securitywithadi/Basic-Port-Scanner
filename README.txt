#How to Use This Script
1. Save the script: Copy the script into a file, for example, port_scanner.py.
2. Install necessary libraries: You might need to install the ipaddress library if you're using an older version of Python (it's included by default in Python 3.3 and later). You can install it via pip:
pip install socket

3. Run the script: Execute the script from your terminal or command prompt. You can specify an IP address or a network as arguments. For example:
python port_scanner.py -i 127.0.0.1
